💻 Implemented interfaces with lambdas to simplify and optimize code.

📅 October 27–29, 2025

📦 Studied Packages — purpose, creation, and import mechanisms.

🚨 Learned Exception Handling: try, catch, finally, throw, and throws.

🧱 Differentiated checked vs. unchecked exceptions and created custom ones.

🎁 Explored Wrapper Classes, autoboxing, and unboxing.

🧩 Integrated packages, exceptions, and wrapper classes in practical programs.

📅 November 3–5, 2025

🧠 Studied Java Generics for writing type-safe and reusable code.

🗂️ Explored the Collections Framework — List, Set, Queue, and Map.

🪄 Practiced ArrayList, HashSet, and HashMap with real coding exercises.

🔐 Understood how Generics ensure type safety in Collections.

🗃️ Learned JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) — architecture and database interaction.

🧾 Performed CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) using MySQL.

🔗 Understood roles of DriverManager, Connection, Statement, and ResultSet in database connectivity.



✨ Summary:
From mastering Git basics 🧭 to implementing real-world Java + JDBC projects 💼, this journey built a solid foundation in Java programming, OOPs, Collections, and Database Connectivity — paving the way toward advanced Java and backend development 🚀.
